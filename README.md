F1 Timeline
The F1 Timeline is a sleek, image-driven showcase of some of the most iconic moments in Formula 1 history — from the first World Championship race in 1950 to modern-day milestones.

The timeline highlights 10 key years between 1950 and 2025, each featuring a striking image and a short description. It’s built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox, keeping it fast and simple.

A bold red-and-black theme captures the adrenaline of the sport, while the clean horizontal layout makes it easy to explore events at a glance. When you tap or click on a year, the event’s image and description appear instantly — no scrolling required.

This is just the start. Future updates will bring more years, light/dark mode, and interactive animations to make the history of Formula 1 even more exciting to relive.
