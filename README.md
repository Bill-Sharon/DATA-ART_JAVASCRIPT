# F1 Timeline

This is a simple little project to show important events from Formula 1 history.

- Right now, you’ll see the very first F1 World Championship from 1950, with an image and a quick description.
- There’s a header at the top with our F1 Timeline logo and a button to (someday!) switch between light and dark mode.
- You’ll also spot a place for pop-ups, but that’s something for the future!

I made this as a starting point for learning about building web pages and practicing HTML structure. More features and events will come later!
